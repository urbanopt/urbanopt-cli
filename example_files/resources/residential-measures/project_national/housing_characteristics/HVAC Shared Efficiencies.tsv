# Description: The presence and efficiency of the shared HVAC system.
# Source: The sample counts and sample weights are constructed using U.S. EIA 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) microdata.
# Assumption: Assume that all Heating and Cooling shared systems are fan coils in each dwelling unit served by a central chiller and boiler.
# Assumption: Assume all Heating Only shared systems are hot water baseboards in each dwelling unit served by a central boiler.
# Assumption: Assume all Cooling Only shared systems are fan coils in each dwelling unit served by a central chiller.
