# Description: The cooling airflow and capacity scaling factor applied to the auto-sizing methodology (not used in project_national).
# Source: Engineering Judgment
# Assumption: HVAC sizing follows ACCA Manual J and Manual S. There is no additional oversizing or undersizing the airflow and capacity of the HVAC system.
