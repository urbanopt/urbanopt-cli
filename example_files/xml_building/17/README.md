The `feature.xml` HPXML file contained in this folder may need to be re-generated due to HPXML schema updates.
It is generated by modifying properties of the "Single-Family Attached" feature (i.e., `"id": "17"`) in `example_project_combined.json` to:

  ```json
  "properties": {
    "id": "17",
    "name": "Residential 4",
    "type": "Building",
    "building_type": "Single-Family Attached",
    "floor_area": 18320,
    "footprint_area": 9160,
    "number_of_stories_above_ground": 2,
    "number_of_stories": 2,
    "number_of_bedrooms": 6,
    "foundation_type": "slab",
    "attic_type": "attic - vented",
    "system_type": "Residential - furnace and room air conditioner",
    "heating_system_fuel_type": "fuel oil",
    "number_of_residential_units": 4,
    "template": "Residential IECC 2015 - Customizable Template Sep 2020"
  }
  ```

After running the feature (e.g., using `bundle exec rake run_baseline`), the resulting `feature.xml` HPXML file from the `run` folder is copied (overwritten) into this folder.
The changes to properties for the "Single-Family Attached" feature in `example_project_combined.json` are then reverted back to using the `hpxml_directory` field.
