The HPXML files contained in this folder may need to be re-generated due to HPXML schema updates. They are generated by modifying properties of `id=17` in `example_project_combined.csv` to:

  ```json
  "type": "Feature",
  "properties": {
    "id": "17",
    "name": "Residential 4",
    "type": "Building",
    "building_type": "Single-Family Attached",
    "floor_area": 18320,
    "footprint_area": 9160,
    "number_of_stories_above_ground": 2,
    "number_of_stories": 2,
    "number_of_bedrooms": 6,
    "foundation_type": "slab",
    "attic_type": "attic - vented",
    "system_type": "Residential - furnace and room air conditioner",
    "heating_system_fuel_type": "fuel oil",
    "number_of_residential_units": 4,
    "template": "Residential IECC 2015 - Customizable Template Sep 2020"
  }
  ```
  
as well as opening each HPXML file and removing the entire `<SchedulesFilePath>` line. They are then copied (overwritten) back into this folder.
